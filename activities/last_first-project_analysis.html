<h1>Client: Top Stone, Inc.</h1>
<h1>Project: Website Redesign</h1>
<h1>Designer: Stephen Smith</h1>
<h1>Document: Project Analysis</h1>

	<p>Site Intent:</p>

	<p>Our goal is to redesign the website topstone1.com to be a compelling informational resource to existing, and potential customers for the company Top Sone, Inc.  
We will redesign the site without the use of frames.  We will also create a organized cohesive layout that will not overwhelm new visitors with clutter.  The current site has 98 W3C validation errors.  That will be addressed and corrected.  The file size will be addressed as well.  Currently it sits at a bloated 3.41 MB.  We will also create a athletically pleasing experience for their customers. Their search and bounce percentages don't even register.  There were no audience demographics for this site available.  </p>

	<p>Competitive Analysis:</p>

	<p>Topstone currently is ranked 3,363,238 globally with 12 inbound links.  Their top search query is "sphere water fountain that turns" at over 39%.
 The average user views 1.4 pages per visit.  The average time spent on their site was 1minute 58 seconds.  Because of the unique nature of their products, they do have top search results already in hand.  </p>



	<p>Targeted Audience</p>

	<p>We will target mid-size to large businesses and organizations to include churches, city municipalities, and large estates. As such, we will create a cleaner website that will appeal to the age demographic of 35-55. We will be conveying the message that a Top Stone monument/fountain will be a status symbol, and provide the proper image for their organization.</p>
