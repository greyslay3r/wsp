		<p>Terms and Conditions:   Top Stone Hand Carved Marble and Granite items are custom orders, sculpted to your specifications, and can take 3 to 4 months to be manufactured and delivered under normal conditions. If the carving facility is running behind schedule it may take longer – there is no guarantee only estimated times on a best efforts basis for final delivery unless otherwise stated in writing. Pictures of your item will be emailed to you for your final approval prior to shipping. Your order will be carefully crated in a wooden crate (s) to assure safe delivery. Please inspect your order carefully upon receipt. Inspect your order in the crate and do not accept your order if damaged. Take photographs of the damage in the crate to verify damage during shipment. Contact Top Stone immediately for further instructions on repairing or replacing your order. No payments will be refunded due to the fact all orders are custom made according to your specifications and cancellation once an order is placed would constitute loss of deposit and/or final payment– Top Stone may try to resell any cancelled order and rebate the customer up to 50% of the money paid on a best efforts basis.  No payments will be refunded due to the fact all orders are custom made according to your specifications and partial or full  cancellation once an order is placed would constitute loss of deposit and/or final payment.  The no refund on custom orders policy/non–refundable deposit is strictly enforced once an order is placed.  Top Stone may try to resell any cancelled order and rebate the customer up to 50% of the money paid on a best efforts basis - but in most cases the resale or salvage value is less than the initial deposit. If the statuary you received is broken, cracked, or has any other damaged parts please notify Top Stone immediately so we can make a report with the shipping carrier – but upon delivery you must notify the shipping company in writing on the delivery slip of  up to 48 hours to allow inspection for internal damages – failure to notify in writing the shipping company on the delivery slip can result in loss of insurance coverage. If delivery is accepted and internal damage is found please save all the broken parts, the container it came in, and all the packing material for the shipper to come out and do an on-site inspection of the damaged package. All shipments we send are insured up to delivery acceptance to cover the costs to replace or repair the order due to shipper negligence.  The laws of the State of Arizona shall govern all orders and interpretation of the agreement.  Venue shall be in Cochise County, Arizona and through civil court procedures only for any unresolved disputes under the rules of contract law.  </p>
